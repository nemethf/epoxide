;;; Commentary:

;; This node provides functionality to query a Floodlight controller for flow
;; statistics of a specific switch given with its DPID.
;; The node has one input that should be an output buffer of a Clock node.
;; It takes three configuration parameters.  #0 specifies the IP address of the
;; host where the controller is running at, #1 is the DPID of interest and
;; optional #3 is the requested stat type.  This last argument defaults to
;; 'flow'.  Other possible values are: port, aggregate, desc, features and
;; queue.
;; The node has one output that lists queried flow statistics.
;; The node connects to the specified Floodlight controller via its REST API.
;; Received data is then processed by giving standard names to the parameters.

;;; Code:

(require 'epoxide)
(require 'url)     ; For accessing REST APIs.
