;;; Commentary:

;; The node queries flow statistics for a specific switch name by way of using
;; `ovs-ofctl dump-flows' shell command.  After data is received it goes through
;; some modifications that replace proprietary parameter naming to EPOXIDE
;; standard.
;; It has one input that should be the output of a Clock node.
;; It takes two configuration parameters: #0 is the connection inforation, #1 is
;; the name of the switch to query.  Connection information could be 127.0.0.1
;; when asking for a local query and <username>@<IP address> or whatever alias
;; there is in your SSH configuration file for remote connections.
;; The node has one output that lists the received flow statistics.
