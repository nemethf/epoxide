;;; Commentary:

;; The node is able to query the ARP cache by evoking the `arp'
;; command.  It has one input that serves as a clock input, each time
;; it changes a query is performed.  The node's first configuration
;; argument specifies the host where the query should be run at and
;; the second one specifies those interfaces that are to be kept
;; (while all the others are discarded) when relaying data to the
;; node's only output.  The list of these interfaces should appear as
;; a semicolon (;) separated list.  When the second argument is not
;; present or set to nil, data is displayed exactly the same as
;; returned by the `arp' command. All subsequent configuration
;; arguments are passed to the `arp' command as command line
;; arguments.
