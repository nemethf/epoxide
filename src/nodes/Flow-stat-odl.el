;;; Commentary:

;; This node provides functionality to query an OpenDaylight controller for
;; flow statistics of a specific switch given with its DPID.
;; The node has one input that should be an output buffer of a Clock node.
;; It takes four configuration parameters.  #0 specifies the IP address of the
;; where the controller is running at, #1 is the DPID of interest and #3 is the
;; username and #4 is the password that enables a connection to be set up with
;; the controller.
;; The node has one output that lists queried flow statistics.
;; The node connects to the specified OpenDaylight controller via its REST API.
;; Received data is then processed by giving standard names to the parameters.

;;; Code:

(require 'epoxide)
(require 'url)     ; For accessing REST APIs.
