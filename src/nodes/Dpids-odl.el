;;; Commentary:

;; Node collects DPID information from an OpenDaylight controller.
;; It has one input that should be an output of a Clock node.
;; It takes one configuration parameter: the IP address of the host where the
;; controller is running at.
;; The node has one output that lists the available DPIDs.  DPIDs are also
;; passed to the EPOXIDE framework's aggregation variables even when the
;; output is disabled.
